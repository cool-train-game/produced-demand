to-do
- feat: should not slow/stop at station when full and nobody wants to go there
- feat: add route limit on stations
- feat: cancel route creation

- fix: bus gets stuck in station circle if there is a bend within circle because it slows to stop before station
- fix: potential error when there are multiple stations on the track within range
- fix: don't allow stations too close to other stations
- fix: bus stuck in station circle if trying to pass through without going to station and station is also on route

later (feats)
- saving (user://)
- dynamically generate people-making ground
- cancel route creation button
- correctly implement pausing
- visually show max amount of routes and stations
- add buses to routes after creation
