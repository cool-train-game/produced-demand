### Bus route management game
It's another day in New Philsberg, and everyone needs to get somewhere, *urgently*. As the usual bus route manager has mysteriously disappeared, it's up to you to ensure everyone can get to where they need to go without walking too far. Keep playing until a bus station overflows, and the people spill out into the streets.
